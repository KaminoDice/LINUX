step 1. open a Terminal window. type the command "dpkg --list" at the prompt and press “Enter”.  
  
step 2. scroll through the list of installed packages in the Terminal window to find the one you want to uninstall.   
        note the full name of the package.

step 3. uninstall a program, "sudo apt-get --purge remove gimp".


(a) If you don’t want to remove the configuration files, simply leave out the “--purge” command, as shown in the following command.
    sudo apt-get remove [gimp]
    
(b) When you uninstall a program, there may be packages that the uninstalled program depended upon that are no longer used. To remove any unused packages, use the “autoremove” command, as shown in the following command.
    sudo apt-get autoremove
    
(c) You can combine the two commands for removing a program and removing dependencies that are no longer being used into one, as shown below (again, two dashes before “auto-remove”).
    sudo apt-get purge --auto-remove [gimp]
    
(d) If you’re short on space, you can use the “clean” command to remove downloaded archive files, as shown below.
    sudo apt-get clean
