https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14721514/how-do-i-install-eclipse-with-c-in-ubuntu-12-10-quantal-quetzal  


I also tried http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/ in Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS and works fine!

First, I downloaded it from www.eclipse.org/downloads/, choosing Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers.
I save the file somewhere, let´s say into my home directory. Open a console or terminal, and type:

>>cd ~; tar xvzf eclipse*.tar.gz;

Remember for having Eclipse running in Linux, it is required a JVM, so download a jdk file e.g jdk-7u17-linux-i586.rpm (I cann´t post the link due to my low reputation) ... anyway
Install the .rpm file following http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Java-on-Linux
Find the path to the Java installation, by typing:

>>which java

I got /usr/bin/java. To start up Eclipse, type:

>>cd ~/eclipse; ./eclipse -vm /usr/bin/java

Also, once everything is installed, in the home directory, you can double-click the executable icon called eclipse, and then you´ll have it!. 

In case you like an icon, create a .desktop file in /usr/share/applications:
>>sudo gedit /usr/share/applications/eclipse.desktop
The .desktop file content is as follows:

[Desktop Entry]  
Name=Eclipse  
Type=Application  
Exec="This is the path of the eclipse executable on your machine"  
Terminal=false 
Icon="This is the path of the icon.xpm file on your machine"  
Comment=Integrated Development Environment  
NoDisplay=false  
Categories=Development;IDE  
Name[en]=eclipse.desktop    
  
    
Best luck!

for example: 
--------------------------------------------
[Desktop Entry]

Name=Eclipse for C++
Name[en]=eclipse.desktop
Type=Application

Exec=/home/tree/Downloads/eclipse/eclipse
Terminal=false

Icon=/home/tree/Downloads/eclipse/icon.xpm
Comment=Integrated Development Environment
NoDisplay=false

Categories=Development;IDE
--------------------------------------------

BE CAREFULL OF THIS TWO LINES:
Exec=/home/tree/Downloads/eclipse/eclipse
Icon=/home/tree/Downloads/eclipse/icon.xpm
