Right Click on the project MakefileIDASH2017, and choose Properties:
If C/C++ Build >> Settings dialog is missing the "Tool Settings" tab, 
to bring the Tool Settings Tab back: In the project properties >> C/C++ Build >> tab "Builder Settings", just check the box for the option "Generate Makefiles automatically" and that will bring back the Tool Settings Tab.

To add the libraries:
Properties >> C/C++ Build >> Settings >> Tool Settings >> GCC C++ Linker >> Libraries 
>> Libraries(-l) : + ntl, + gmp, + HEAAN 
                  # This will append -lntl, -lgmp, and -lHEAAN to the g++ command.
>> Library search path(-L) : + /usr/local/lib, + /home/tree/Downloads/HEAAN/HEAAN/lib
                  # add the directory path which can locate the above libraries. 

Now, building this project will show this message:
../MakefileIDASH2017.cpp:9:10: fatal error: BootContext.h: No such file or directory
 #include "BootContext.h"
          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is because we need to add the .h files to its includes.

>> GNU C++ >> Include directories : /home/tree/Downloads/HEAAN/HEAAN/src
   # add the Include directories where can find the .h files of libraries.

Now, building this project will show this message:

/usr/bin/ld: /home/tree/Downloads/ntl-11.3.0/src/../include/NTL/tools.h:665: undefined reference to `pthread_key_create'
This is because we need to append the -pthread option to the g++ command.
Properties >> C/C++ Build >> Settings >> Tool Settings >> GCC C++ Linker >> Miscellaneous
Linker flags : -pthread

Now, building this project will show this message:

/usr/bin/ld: /home/tree/Downloads/ntl-11.3.0/src/lip.cpp:5484: undefined reference to `__gmpn_sub_n'
It is because of the order of lntl and lgmp in C/C++ Build >> Settings >> Tool Settings 
>> GCC C++ Linker >> Libraries >> Libraries(-l) : [ ntl gmp m HEAAN ]
