#1
local file  >>>  local directory
scp  initrd.img   root@45.32.28.231:root/home
result: the file "initrd.img" in the same directory of home is copied to the local directory "root@45.32.28.231:root/home"



#2
can use scp just like cp when the sourcefile and targetfile/targetdirectory are both local file or directory
scp initrd.img  home/ 
after this line, the directory "home" has a copy of "initrd.img".
