Xshell, FlashFXP both work well! just like the normal operation.
Even GMP, NTL and HElib can also be installed correctly!

the installation with Shadowsocks still needs more debug.
the vps with ipv6 can not access normal web files located in a place with ipv4.
can download the files needed on advance and use FlashFXP to upload to the vps.
Even ss is installed, still can not access google.com which has ipv6.
