https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9224298/how-do-i-fix-certificate-errors-when-running-wget-on-an-https-url-in-cygwin
For example, running wget https://www.dropbox.com results in the following errors:

ERROR: The certificate of `www.dropbox.com' is not trusted.
ERROR: The certificate of `www.dropbox.com' hasn't got a known issuer.

method 1:
If you don't care about checking the validity of the certificate just add the --no-check-certificate option on the wget command-line. This worked well for me.
NOTE: This opens you up to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, and is not recommended for anything where you care about security.

method 2:
If the problem is that a known root CA is missing and when you are using ubuntu or debian, then you can solve the problem with this one line:

sudo apt-get install ca-certificates

apt-get is on cygwin ? apt-get is on redgat ? ;) – Denis Chenu Jun 2 '14 at 12:30
ca-certificates was already installed in my computer. Running update-ca-certificates solved the problem. – Tomás Fox Feb 19 '15 at 2:10
This worked also on my Synology DS215j with Debian chroot. – microspino Dec 18 '15 at 16:11
@fox update-ca-certificates is a ubuntu command, not available in debian. – Devy Aug 22 '16 at 16:21
@Devy It actually worked on my raspberry pi running debian wheezy – Luis Lobo Borobia Sep 5 '17 at 12:32
